# R_VisProject
The purpose of this project is to to simplify and increase comprehensibility and communication efficiency on existing visualizations for the white metal_bands_2017.csv dataset. Existing visualizations for this dataset we are going to use are located publicly on https://data.world/ and https://www.kaggle.com and have been created either with R or Python.
